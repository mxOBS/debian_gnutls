Description: the GNU TLS library - development files
 gnutls is a portable library which implements the Transport Layer
 Security (TLS) 1.0 and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 3.0 protocols.
 .
 Currently gnutls implements:
  - the TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0 protocols, without any US-export
    controlled algorithms
  - X509 Public Key Infrastructure (with several limitations).
  - SRP for TLS authentication.
  - TLS Extension mechanism
 .
 This package contains the gnutls development files.

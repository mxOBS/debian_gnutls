Excerpt from upstream's README:
LICENSE ISSUES
--------------

Since the 0.4.2 version the gnutls library is covered under the GNU
Lesser GPL. Previously released versions were licensed under the GNU
GPL.

We changed the license for most of GNUTLS because other free libraries
already exist that do the same jobs and have lax licenses.  We want
GNUTLS to be usable in all the same places as those other libraries.
We kept some parts of GNUTLS under the GPL because they are unique,
and with the GPL they provide free software projects (which deserve
our help) an advantage over non-free projects (which do not deserve
our help, since they refuse to share with us).  For more explanation,
see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html.

The GNU Lesser GPL license applies to the main gnutls library, while
the gnutls-extra library is under the GPL. The gnutls-extra library
contains the code for "GnuTLS Inner Application" support and the
OpenSSL compatibility layer.  The gnutls library is located in the
lib/ directory, while the gnutls-extra library is at libextra/.
